##Introduction

Greetings, fellow coding enthusiasts!

I would like to present to you my C++ Programming project, which demonstrates a falling matrix effect, something like what can be seen in the movie "The Matrix".
While this project is not up to the standard I would like it to be and it is just a *tad* bit late, I hope you will at the very least enjoy my blog on this project

#Background
**What is a Falling Matrix Effect?** 
This is a piece of code that allows random characters to be printed on the screen in random positions and fall to the bottom of the screen, just like rain. Its pretty cool, and can 
make for a pretty nifty laptop background!

#Research
Before doing this project I had to do some research and see how the falling matrix effect was implemented in different ways and different languages.
One site I looked at indeptly before doing this project was [GeekForGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/implementation-falling-matrix/). 
Here they showed in a very simple way how the effect can be created. I also looked many other github repositories, but none of those examples were in C++, so I was not really able to
grasp anything from them.

##Design and Test

For the design and testing of the Digital Rain effect, I used Microsoft Visual Studio 2022 as an IDE for writing code and the code was written in Procedural and Object Oriented C++.
To keep it simple, I implemeted simple "getters" and "setters" that allows me to set the screen size (i.e., the area where the rain appears) and the character string, as well as the sleep time (controls the speed at which the rain "falls"). 


Font can be *Italic* or **Bold**.

Code can be highlighted with 'backticks'.

Hyperlinks look like this: [GitHub Help](https://help.github.com/).

A bullet list:

- vectors
- algorithms
- iterators

You can add an impage that has been uploaded to the repository in a /docs/assets/images folder.
